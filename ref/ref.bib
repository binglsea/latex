Fluids are modelled by a variety of constitutive equations including the Newtonian, the Carreau and the Phan-Thien-Tanner models. The influence of inertia, shear-thinning and fluid elasticity on the flow field, drag and the pressure drop force-drag ratio is examined. Some results are compared with available experimental data.},

This outline gives my view of what the basic concepts of modern continuum mechanics and thermodynamics are and how they should be presented to graduate students of mathematics and theoretical mechanics. This view evolved gradually over the past eight years. A first version was given in a series of lectures I delivered at the Summer Session in Bressanone, Italy, in 1965 (reference [1]). The material was reworked several times for an introductory graduate course repeatedly given at Carnegie-Mellon University and for lecture series given at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1968 and in Jablonna, Poland, in 1970. This paper is the latest version, and it renders reference [1] obsolete.},
